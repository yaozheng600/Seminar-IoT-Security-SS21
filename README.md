## Topic Selection:

**IoT with Blockchain: Related technologies and application scenarios**

**ideas:** The Internet of Things faces security challenges. Blockchain can provide infrastructure support for IoT and help solve security problems in IoT; while the Internet of Things provides a large number of landing scenarios for the blockchain.  

      Technologies: 1. Decentralized identity 
                    2. Decentralized access control(e.g. IPFS) 
                    3. Enhancing the confidence of IoT data(e.g. EdgeX Foundry)
      
      Applications: 1. Connection of IoT data island 
                    2. Smart Home, Smart City...
                    3. Internet of Vehicles(e.g. Electric vehicles cloud and edge, EVCE)
                    4. and so on...
Both of these two parts can be extensively studied and focused in more depth.
