## Topic Selection:
### Preference 1
**IoT with Blockchain: Related technologies and application scenarios**

**ideas:** The Internet of Things faces security challenges. Blockchain can provide infrastructure support for IoT and help solve security problems in IoT; while the Internet of Things provides a large number of landing scenarios for the blockchain.  

      Technologies: 1. Decentralized identity 
                    2. Decentralized access control(e.g. IPFS) 
                    3. Enhancing the confidence of IoT data(e.g. EdgeX Foundry)
      
      Applications: 1. Connection of IoT data island 
                    2. Smart Home, Smart City...
                    3. Internet of Vehicles(e.g. Electric vehicles cloud and edge, EVCE)
                    4. and so on...
Both of these two parts can be extensively studied and focused in more depth.
### Preference 2
**Trusted Execution Environment(TEE) in IoT**

**ideas:** In recent years, the concept of trusted execution environment(TEE) has been very popular in the field of IoT security. For example, it is widely used in smart phones, and almost all new Android phones on the market have TEE. I want to explore these questions:
1. What question does TEE solve?
2. What's the Difference of different TEE technologies?
3. Is it necessary for TEE to be integrated in IoT terminals? If so, what capabilities can help the terminal or the Internet of Things improve the security level?
